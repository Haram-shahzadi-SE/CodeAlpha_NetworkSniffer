# 🖥️ Basic Network Sniffer

This project is part of my **Cyber Security Internship at CodeAlpha**.  
The goal is to build a **basic network sniffer** in Python that captures and analyzes network traffic packets.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Captures live network packets.
- Displays:
  - **Source IP**
  - **Destination IP**
  - **Protocol (TCP/UDP/Other)**
  - **Payload (first 50 bytes)**
- Uses the `scapy` library for packet sniffing.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Scapy library** (`pip install scapy`)
- **Npcap (Windows only)** for packet capture support
